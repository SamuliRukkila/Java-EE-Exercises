# Part 2 assignments - JSF & PrimeFace

### #1 JSF-tutorial

In this assignment I do JSF-tutorial where we'll dive into the basics of servlets, named bean etc. It's a simple authentication login-form
which will redirect user to corresponding site according to credentials.

### #2 Dice-throwing application with JSF + Ajax

In this assignment we modified older dice-throwing program made with JSTL and beans. Using JSF-syntax to produce facelets and using @Named -beans we converted it to JSF-program.

### #3 Mysql-example with JSF

We'll modify a ready-made program which can insert new users into a table using JSF. The program didn't support the connection to MySQL-server with JSF yet so it was implemented.

### #4 JSF-Application with MySQL

We'll create a JSF-application from stratch. Application will consist of 2 facelet pages; other for viewing all the customers from table in rows and the other for adding new customers to the table via form.

### #5 JSF-Application with MySQL + PrimeFace-table (Part 2)

We'll further modify upper assignment by changing the viewing table and submit -form into PrimeFace's elements. Including JAR in WEB-INF/ -folder and adding another link to XHTML.

### #6 JSF-Application with MYSQL + PrimeFace-table + SPA (Part 3)
