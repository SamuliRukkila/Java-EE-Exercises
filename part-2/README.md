# Part 1 assignments

### #1 JSF-tutorial

In this assignment I do JSF-tutorial where we'll dive into the basics of servlets, named bean etc. It's a simple authentication login-form
which will redirect user to corresponding site according to credentials.

### #2 Dice-throwing application with JSF + Ajax

In this assignment we modified older dice-throwing program made with JSTL and beans. Using JSF-syntax to produce facelets and using @Named -beans we converted it to JSF-program.

### #3 Mysql-example with JSF

We'll modify a ready-made program which can insert new users into a table using JSF. The program didn't support the connection to MySQL-server with JSF yet so it was implemented.
