# Part 3 assignments - JPA, Web services & EJB

### #1 JPA Maven -application with MySQL (console only)

In this assignment I created a simple console -application with JPA and MySQL. It's a text-interface 
where you can CRUD-operations (without update) on books and book-groups via user input.

### #2 JPA + JSF + Primeface application: Show customers and add new ones

Updating an older exercise (Part 2 | Exercise 6) to make a connection to MySQL using JPA -annotations 
instead of JSF's. 

### #3 JAX-RS + JPA - REST-API

Updating upper exercise to convert it to REST-API with JAX-RS and JPA. It only has an introduction site, which
what sort of HTTP-calls you can make (for example with Postman). Includes basic CRUD -operations like: create,
delete and find.
